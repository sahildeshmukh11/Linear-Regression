# Linear-Regression
Description:

This project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating house prices using the Linear Regression algorithm. The dataset, Housing.csv, contains various features that influence the selling price of houses, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage of living area, lot size, number of floors, and other property-related attributes.

The primary objective is to understand the relationship between these independent variables and the target variable (house price), and to build a regression model that can accurately forecast prices for new data.

Methodology:
Data Exploration:

Loaded the housing dataset and inspected its structure.

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and detect patterns.

Checked for missing values and outliers.

Data Preprocessing:

Encoded categorical variables (if any) into numerical format.

Normalized or scaled numerical variables when necessary.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

Model Development:

Implemented Linear Regression using scikit-learn.

Trained the model on the training data and evaluated it on the testing set.

Measured model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² score.

Model Interpretation:

Analyzed regression coefficients to understand feature importance.

Visualized the regression line and compared actual vs. predicted prices.
